          <p>
            We'll provide you access to a private portal that you can use to provide short-term rental valuations for your vendors in real-time. You can check the progress of leads and analyze the performance of your team across locations.

          <p>We manage the entire process of hosting guests who pay on a nightly basis while your vendor's property is on the market. This means your vendor earns during the entire sales process. You don't have to do anything.</p>

          <h4 class="timeline-content-date">Go under contract</h4>
          <p>
            Once your property goes under contract, we will agree a date to discontinue short-term rental bookings to proceed to a swift exchange and completion after conveyancing.

          <h4 class="timeline-content-date">Exchange &amp; complete</h4>
          <p>
            During exchange we'll remove the property from all short-term rental sites and remove all furnishings (unless the buyer wishes to acquire them). At completion your vendor will be satisfied with the increased sale price and revenue they received while the property was on the market.
