                <h4 class="subheader">He is our operations guy.</h4>
                <p class="lead">Ollie is from Norwich, born and bred. He is a Paramedic who left the NHS seven years ago to setup his own company called <a href="https://www.proeventmedical.com/">ProEvent Medical</a>.</p>
                <p>
                  As a result of his experience as a Paramedic and at ProEvent Medical, Ollie knows operations. When other people's lives are in your hands you need to do the right thing at the right time. Large festivals and events across the UK have trusted Ollie and his team with this responsibility for the last seven years.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ollie takes pride in the responsibility that property owners give him when handing him the keys to their property. He is driven to the highest standards of quality and settles for nothing less than absolute excellence.

        <h3 class="subheader h4">Two entrepreneurs and a dilemma</h3>
        <p class="lead">
          What happens when a Silicon Valley entrepreneur meets a Norfolk paramedic who has been burned by estate agents?
        </p>

            <h5 class="timeline-content-date">Ollie's dilemma</h5>
            <p>
              A local Norfolk paramedic named Ollie had a problem. He needed to rent his property for six months, but wasn't willing to endure another bad experience with estate agents.

        </div>

        <div class="timeline-item">

          <div class="timeline-content right">
            <h5 class="timeline-content-date">A Silicon Valley guide</h5>
            <p>
              Ollie's friend John had just concluded a career in Silicon Valley where Airbnb was founded. Listing his property on Airbnb seemed like an obvious solution to Ollie's problem. The only problem was that no one in Norwich was offering to manage properties on platforms like Airbnb and Booking.com.

        <div class="timeline-item">

          <div class="timeline-content">
            <h5 class="timeline-content-date">Market opportunity</h5>
            <p>
              John and Ollie, who both run other businesses, realized the market opportunity: With over 330 Airbnb properties in Norwich and no professional managing agents, something had to be done...
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-item--last">

          <div class="timeline-content right">
            <h5 class="timeline-content-date">Airbnb adventure</h5>
             <p>
               So they decided to do it themselves to see if there was a viable business model. Within 13 days of listing the property, it was booked solidly for 90 consecutive days.
